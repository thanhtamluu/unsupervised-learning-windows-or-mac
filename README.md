# unsupervised-learning-windows-or-mac
Analyzing and interpreting an unsupervised learning problem (Windows or Mac?) based on collected survey data. The problem was approached from the perspective of the Big Five personality traits as well as the Hult DNA. These factors were taken into account during proper separation of data based on its purpose and characteristics (demographics, psychometrics, etc.) and when utilizing appropriate unsupervised learning techniques such as K-Means clustering and PCA. The analysis provided key insights to specific patterns among the respondents and identified important target groups.
